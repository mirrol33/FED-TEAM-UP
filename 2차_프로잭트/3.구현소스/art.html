            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              “Adventure is out there!” is the familiar
              motto from Up that inspired many. And the
              directors and artists proved it to themselves
              when they sought firsthand reference to design
              the pinnacle world where Carl’s journey would
              end. Together, they climbed mountains,
              trampled through jungle, and even got caught
              in a storm atop a tepui mountain in South
              America. “The research trip to Venezuela was
              one of the highlights of my career,” said
              Production Designer Ricky Nierva, “but I’m
              also glad we made it back alive to make the
              movie!”

            <h2>The House</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike most stories about leaving home, Up
              needed a house that would go along for the
              journey. The Pixar team treated Carl’s house
              like a film character, touring vintage Oakland
              and Berkeley neighborhoods to cast for the
              right mix of comfort and familiarity, with
              just a touch of melancholy. “We were trying to
              make Carl’s house look like your grandparents’
              house smelled,” explained Producer Jonas
              Rivera.

            <h2>Tepui</h2>
            <p>
              Carl’s epic adventure required a destination
              both fantastic and plausible. When Director
              Pete Docter happened on a television
              documentary about the mysterious tepuis of
              South America, he discovered the perfect world
              to explore. The massive mile-high plateaus in
              Venezuela are among the most uncharted places
              on Earth. Pixar sent a team of artists for a
              look, and the film's bizarre rock formations,
              exotic flora, towering waterfall, and
              fog-shrouded labyrinth can be traced to tepui
              landscapes. So fantastic were the images,
              Docter wondered if the very real Tepuis might
              look too incredible.

            <h2>The Airship</h2>
            <p>
              With Charles Muntz, the most fabled adventurer
              of his day, the filmmakers gave him the 1930s’
              most state-of-the-art airship. Encouraged to
              indulge in size and detail, the artists
              created a half-mile-long art deco masterpiece
              filled with the spoils of a hero turned
              villain. Still, there were issues of how far
              to take the airship. “We had a trophy room
              with an Easter Island head in there,” recalled
              Production Artist Noah Klocek. “At one point
              John Lasseter said 'no, that would sink the
              ship'.”
